# Cleaning-Robot

In recent years, cleaning robots like Roomba have gained popularity. These cleaning robots have limited battery power, and therefore, efficient cleaning is important. Efforts are being undertaken to improve the efficiency of cleaning robots. Most of the previous works have used on-robot cameras, developed dirt detection sensors which are mounted on the cleaning robot, or built a map of the environment to clean periodically. In this project, we are implementing a household helper robotâ€™s backend system. The robot will scan the map of a room/floor  which is assigned to it.Then it will take the destination to be cleaned along with the amount of dust on it and then generate an optimum path cleaning all the locations preferring them according to the dust reach there by dodging the obstacles of the room efficiently and will clean it.
